OSINT<br/>
Medium, 100 pts<br/>

### Description
"We found out that Mr.B met with a journalist to help him publish what he knew, we don't know when or where exactly, but our guess is they met in a hotel, see if Mr.B shared anything about this meeting in social media.<br/>
All we know about him besides his alias, is a strange name known to be used by him (THE4llANDP0werfu1MrB).<br/>
Find the hotel's name and submit the flag like below:<br/>
Hotel Name: Test Hotel, Flag: SBCTF{Test}"<br/>

<br/><br/><br/>

### Solution
We google `"THE4llANDP0werfu1MrB"` and find [his instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/the4llandp0werfu1mrb/)<br/>
We reverse image search and find that the hotel is Bellagio<br/>
